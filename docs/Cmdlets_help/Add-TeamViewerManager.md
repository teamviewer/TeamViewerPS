## DESCRIPTION

Adds a manager to a managed device or a managed group. Managers can either be
identified by a TeamViewer account ID or their manager ID.
The current account (identified by the API access token) needs
`ManagerAdministration` manager permissions on the device/group.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
PS /> Add-TeamViewerManager -Device 'c0cb303a-8a85-4e54-b657-a4757c791aef' -Manager '57e8f75e-8e6f-4450-a59d-10e02ccf5986'
```

Add the manager with the given Manager ID to the managed device with the given
device ID.

### Example 2

```powershell
PS /> Add-TeamViewerManager -Group '9fd16af0-c224-4242-998e-a7138b038dbb' -Manager '57e8f75e-8e6f-4450-a59d-10e02ccf5986'
```

Add the manager with the given Manager ID to the managed group with the given
group ID.

### Example 3

```powershell
PS /> Add-TeamViewerManager -Group '9fd16af0-c224-4242-998e-a7138b038dbb' -AccountId 1234
```

Add the manager with the given TeamViewer account ID to the managed group with
the given group ID.

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Group

Object that can be used to identify the managed group.
This can either be the managed group ID (as string or GUID) or a managed group

### -Permissions

Optional permissions to give to the manager.
By default, the manager receives an empty set of permissions, which still allows

Multiple values can be specified.

`ManagerAdministration` allows the manager to change other managers on the given
device or group.

`DeviceAdministration` (only for managed devices) allows the manager to change
device-specific properties, e.g. the device name. Also reqruied to add devices
to managed groups.

`GroupAdministration` (only for managed groups) allows the manager to change
group-specific properties, e.g. the group name. Also required to add managed
devices to the group.

`PolicyAdministration` (only for managed devices) allows the manager to change
the policy that has been assigned to the managed device.

`EasyAccess` allows the manager to connect to the device (or the devices of the
group) via "EasyAccess" (without additional password).

```yaml

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -User

User object received by the `Get-TeamViewerUser` cmdlet. It can be used to
identify the manager that should be added to the device/group.

```yaml
Type: Object

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
